Description: Pathway enrichment is a crucial step in any downstream analysis of integrative framworks from multi-omics datasets. Once the differential expression analysis is conducted, the result is often analyzed for their function footprints through the pathway enrichment analysis. A common practice is to use known pathway annotations (e.g., KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways, etc.) to see their overlaps with identified group of DEGs, usually called over-represntation analysis, which is often uses a statistical hypothesis test, namely Hypergeometric test. This steps of enrichment test generates the results in tabular form, which includes pathways/functional terms, the overlapping genes/ORFs/Proteins and the statistical significace score (usually p-value and adjusted p-value).
    However, this results essentially reports the functional footprints in a univariate manner, i.e., doesn't show the relationships among the enriched pathways or functional terms, which could be very important to know how those pathways or functional terms interacts with each other, something can be defined as functional cross-talk. 
        this package will be able to help user to not only visualize those functional cross-talks among the enriched pathways or functional terms as a publication-ready network plot, but also enable the user to identify which critical part of the whole biological system plays the driving role for the perturbation.
